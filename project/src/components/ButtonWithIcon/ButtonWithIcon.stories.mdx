# Button With Icon

These components have their development based on the library [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/).

For each implementation, the related component of the library must be imported into the application.

To get the code snippet from `Canvas`:

## Button with text

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Primary Button With Text"
    args={{
      type: "button",
      variant: "primary",
      label: "Like",
      icon: <ThumbsUp size={24} weight="bold" aria-hidden={true} />,
      children: "Like",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
