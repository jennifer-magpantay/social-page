# Icon Button 

Differently of `ButtonWithIcon`, which receives an icon and text as children, the `IconButton` receives only an icon as child. 

These components have their development based on the library [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/).

For each implementation, the related component of the library must be imported into the application.

To get the code snippet from `Canvas`:

## Button Like

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Like Button"
    args={{
      type: "button",
      label: "Like button",
      icon: (
        <ThumbsUp size={24} weight="bold" color="#475569" aria-hidden={true} />
      ),
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Button Comment

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Comment Button"
    args={{
      type: "button",
      label: "Comment button",
      icon: (
        <ChatCentered size={24} weight="bold" color="#475569" aria-hidden={true} />
      ),
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
