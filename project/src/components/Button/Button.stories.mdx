# Button

Let's define the stories for our `Button` component:

<!-- Add stories -->

## Primary Button

The Primary Button is the main button of the application, getting user attention for an action.

To get a code snippet from `Canvas`:

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Primary"
    args={{
      type: "button",
      variant: "primary",
      children: "Primary",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Secondary Button

The Secondary Button could be used alongside the primary button or as itself.

As its name suggests, it calls the user attention for an action, but not as relevant as the Primary Button.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Secondary"
    args={{
      type: "button",
      variant: "secondary",
      children: "Secondary",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Disabled Button

If the button is set as disabled, if should looks like the following:

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Primary Disabled"
    args={{
      type: "button",
      variant: "primary",
      isDisabled: "true",
      children: "Primary",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Secondary Disabled"
    args={{
      type: "button",
      variant: "secondary",
      isDisabled: "true",
      children: "Secondary",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
